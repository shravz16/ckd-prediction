# Chronic Kidney Disease Detection using Naive Bayers and Logistic Regression
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing medical issue that declines the
productivity of renal capacities and subsequently damages the kidneys. CKD is very
common nowadays; cardiovascular infection and end-stage renal illness are two life
threatening diseases that can be caused as after- effects of CKD. These are
conceivably preventable through early recognizable conditions and treatment of people
who are in danger. The expectation of medical problems is a very troublesome
assignment. CKD is particularly one of the most lethal diseases in the clinical field.
Before it becomes too late to recognize CKD forecast, to get rid of risks, the prediction
of risk factor is a major necessary step in the immediate stage. In this research work
three algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, Simple Logistic regression,Linear Regression
model are used to predict the risk factors of CKD. Considering the orderly execution and
investigations of these strategies, three algorithms give a superior and quicker
characterization execution.individual algorithms are applied to the dataset and the best
outcomes have been acquired through the classification of predicting risk factors

Prediction accuracy
1. Naive Bayers - 93%
2. Logistic Regression - 95%
